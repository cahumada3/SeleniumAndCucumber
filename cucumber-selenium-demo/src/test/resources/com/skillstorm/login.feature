@login
Feature: User Login

  Scenario Outline: Successful login with credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid "<username>" and "<password>" 
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be redirected to the main page
    And I should see a sign off link

  Examples:
    |username | password |
    |admin    | admin    |
    |jsmith   | Demo1234 |
